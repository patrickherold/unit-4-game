# unit-4-game
A jquery number guessing game

Each game you get a new 'Magic Number'.  You're trying click on crystals that add up to the magic number. 

Each time you click a crystal it's "hidden" value will be added to your count. 

If your count equals the magic number YOU WIN!!!

This game features SPINNING CRYSTALS!!!!  Holy smokes, win the game and they'll all sping in vitory.
Also, so you don't get bored, each game randomly selects a unique crystal image for each of the four cyrstals. 
This is a little tricky to avoid duplicates, but I think the idea will be useful many places. 

Each time you start a new game you'll get new crystals and each crystal will be assigned a new value. 

Enjoy!
